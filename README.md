# Running Llama 2 and other Open-Source LLMs on CPU Inference Locally for Document Q&A

### Clearly explained guide for running quantized open-source LLM applications on CPUs using LLama 2, C Transformers, GGML, and LangChain

## Context
- Third-party commercial large language model (LLM) providers like OpenAI's GPT4 have democratized LLM use via simple API calls. 
- However, there are instances where teams would require self-managed or private model deployment for reasons like data privacy and residency rules.
- The proliferation of open-source LLMs has opened up a vast range of options for us, thus reducing our reliance on these third-party providers. 
- When we host open-source LLMs locally on-premise or in the cloud, the dedicated compute capacity becomes a key issue. While GPU instances may seem the obvious choice, the costs can easily skyrocket beyond budget.
- In this project, we will discover how to run quantized versions of open-source LLMs on local CPU inference for document question-and-answer (Q&A).

## Quickstart
- Ensure you have downloaded the GGML binary file from https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGML and placed it into the `models/` folder
- There is a sample PDF file in `data/pdf` folder as described in [Step 1 — Process data and build vector store](https://towardsdatascience.com/running-llama-2-on-cpu-inference-for-document-q-a-3d636037a3d8). You are welcome to add others before run `python db_build.py`.
- To start parsing user queries into the application, launch the terminal from the project directory and run the following command:
`poetry run python main.py "<user query>"`
- For example, `poetry run python main.py "What is the minimum guarantee payable by Adidas?"`
- Note: Omit the prepended `poetry run` if you are NOT using Poetry

## Tools
- **LangChain**: Framework for developing applications powered by language models
- **C Transformers**: Python bindings for the Transformer models implemented in C/C++ using GGML library
- **FAISS**: Open-source library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)**: Open-source pre-trained transformer model for embedding text to a 384-dimensional dense vector space for tasks like clustering or semantic search.
- **Llama-2-7B-Chat**: Open-source fine-tuned Llama 2 model designed for chat dialogue. Leverages publicly available instruction datasets and over 1 million human annotations. 
- **Poetry**: Tool for dependency management and Python packaging

## Optional configuration
- Default vector database is FAISS. You might also want to try Milvus (e.g. [Docker Compose](https://milvus.io/docs/install_standalone-docker.md)). If so change the `VECTOR_DATABASE: milvus` in config/config.yml along with other milvus attributes.
