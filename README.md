# End to End ChatPDF for enterprise networks (CPU and GPU inference available)


**Step-by-step guide on TowardsDataScience**: https://towardsdatascience.com/running-llama-2-on-cpu-inference-for-document-q-a-3d636037a3d8

## Context
- Third-party commercial large language model (LLM) providers like OpenAI's GPT4 have democratized LLM use via simple API calls. 
- However, there are instances where teams would require self-managed or private model deployment for reasons like data privacy and residency rules.
- The proliferation of open-source LLMs has opened up a vast range of options for us, thus reducing our reliance on these third-party providers.Â 
- When we host open-source LLMs locally on-premise or in the cloud, the dedicated compute capacity becomes a key issue. While GPU instances may seem the obvious choice, the costs can easily skyrocket beyond budget.
- In this project, we will discover how to run quantized versions of open-source LLMs on local CPU inference for document question-and-answer (Q&A).

## Quickstart
- Ensure you have node installed on your device and npm.
- **Frontend**: Run npm start in the qa directory
- **Backend**: Run python3.8 main.py --local (if you want to run it without the need of OpenAI models) [If you want to make it online use --online]

## Tools
- **LangChain**: Framework for developing applications powered by language models
- **C Transformers**: Python bindings for the Transformer models implemented in C/C++ using GGML library
- **FAISS**: Open-source library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors.
- **Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)**: Open-source pre-trained transformer model for embedding text to a 384-dimensional dense vector space for tasks like clustering or semantic search.
- **Llama-2-7B-Chat**: Open-source fine-tuned Llama 2 model designed for chat dialogue. Leverages publicly available instruction datasets and over 1 million human annotations. 
- **React**: Web development framework
- **FastAPI**: Python backend framework
